# Titanic Wiki

Useful resources for all things related to Titanic, which soon will *(hopefully)* be added to the main website.

## Contributing

The wiki is formatted using Markdown, a markup language that allows for text to have basic styling.
[adam-p's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a fantastic reference to quickly learn about Markdown.

To actually make changes to the wiki and contribute, you'll need some basic amount of knowledge for [Git](https://git-scm.com). But luckily, the osu! wiki project has already made a great guide on how to deal with Git and GitHub [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu%21_wiki/Contribution_guide).

If you have further questions or need some more help, feel free to ask around in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qupv72e7YH) server.
