# Beatmap Approval Team

The Beatmap Approval Team (_BAT_) are a group of members who are in charge of ranking beatmaps that meet the standards of the [Ranking Criteria](https://github.com/osuTitanic/wiki/blob/main/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/en.md).


## Becoming a BAT

Becoming a member of the Beatmap Approval Team requires both a decent amount of knowledge in mapping and understanding of the Ranking Criteria. Potential members must apply while applications are open and are discussed internally for the role. If the majority of the active members agrees that a member has potential, or don't have any issues with their ability, they are added to the team.


## Roles and responsibilities

Members of the Beatmap Approval Team are responsible primarily for managing the moderation of pending beatmaps into the ranking cycle. The BAT are members to go for any modding or advice requests about mapping or gameplay related.


## Current members

*Please note: All BAT members speak English unless otherwise noted.*
