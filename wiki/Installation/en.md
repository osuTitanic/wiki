# Installation

To begin playing on Titanic! you can head over to the [downloads page](https://osu.titanic.sh/download/) and pick any client from as old as 2007 up to 2014.

After it finishes installing, all you have to do is extract the folder and double-click `osu!.exe`.

There is a chance that Windows Defender may block it, since the game is unsigned (a certificate for that would cost 200$).

## Registering an account

To register an account you can go to the [registration page](https://osu.titanic.sh/account/register) by clicking on "I'm New!" (**Remember you are only allowed to have *ONE* account EVER!**)

### Step 2: Installation of osu-winello

`git clone https://github.com/NelloKudo/osu-winello.git`                                                                                                       
`cd osu-winello`                                                                                                                                          
`chmod +x ./osu-winello.sh`                                                                                                                               
`./osu-winello.sh`

### Step 4: Installing the tweaks into Lutris

`osu-wine --lutris` this will copy the necessary files and tweaks for Lutris.
Type `y` then hit enter. It will give instructions to add osu!stable to Lutris. Since we are not installing osu!stable. The below is how to install Titanic in Lutris.

### Step 5: Install Titanic through Lutris

Unzip the .zip file downloaded from the Titanic site, you will get your osu! installation.

Secondly open Lutris and let it load fully for first startup

Then click the plus icon on top left. Then "Add locally installed game".
Give it a proper name and such. Set the runner to Wine.
