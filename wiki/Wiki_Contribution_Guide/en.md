This is a step-by-step guide on how you can help make changes to the wiki.

To begin with you will need to have a basic knowledge of GitHub or [git](https://git-scm.com/). It's okay if you get confused, you can always ask in the [Titanic! Discord server](https://discord.gg/qupv72e7YH) in the `#wiki` channel.

## Editing the article

We recommend reading the [osu! wiki's contribution guide](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu!_wiki/Contribution_guide) since a lot of that will also apply to the Titanic wiki.
