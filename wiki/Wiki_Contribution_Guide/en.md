# Titanic! Wiki Contribution Guide

Thanks for your interest in helping improve the Titanic! wiki. We really appreciate it.
This is a step-by-step guide on how you can help make changes to the wiki.

To begin with you will need to have a basic knowledge of GitHub or [git](https://git-scm.com/). It's okay if you get confused, you can always ask in the [Titanic! Discord server](https://discord.gg/qupv72e7YH) in the `#wiki` channel.

## Editing The Wiki

We recommend reading the [osu! wiki's contribution guide](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu!_wiki/Contribution_guide) since a lot of that will also apply to the Titanic wiki.

## Review

## Merge 

To get your changes merged you will need a [[wiki maintainer]] to approve the changes. If nothing happens after a few days you can ask in the comments of the pull request, or in the `#Wiki` channel in the [Titanic Discord server](https://discord.gg/vxWCkXcARq).
